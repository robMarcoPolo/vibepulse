# Lessons log

What has bitten this project, why, and the rule each bite taught. The
full narratives live in the commit messages (keep writing them there —
that practice is the best thing this repo does); this file is the index
that makes them findable without `git log -p`, so the same mistake
doesn't need to be paid for twice.

**When to add an entry:** any fix whose commit message tells a
root-cause story, any comb finding (see
[observability.md](observability.md)) that turned into an "oh, *that's*
why", any physical-hardware surprise. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD · Title that names the mistake
What happened · Root cause · The rule now · Guards (commits, tests, fixtures) · Watch for
```

Keep entries under ~12 lines. If a guard doesn't exist yet, say so and
point at the backlog item.

## 2026-09-17 · Raising the flush height squeezes the DMA budget from both ends

**What happened:** the swipe ran at 5 FPS with the CPU pegged at 100 %.
`DISPLAY_FLUSH_ROWS 12` turned out to be a **40x multiplier on tree walks** —
LVGL's `PARTIAL` mode splits the invalid area into strips of the draw-buffer
height and calls `refr_area()` once per strip (`lv_refr.c`), each walking the
whole object tree. Raising it to 20 looked like free speed. It fired the
`LÅGT DMA-block` warning twice in 70 seconds. **Root cause:** the height sets
the *requirement* (`rows x 480 x 2`) **and** shrinks the *supply* — the same
constant feeds `max_transfer_sz`, and the SPI driver takes its DMA
descriptors from internal RAM, measured at ~768 B of largest-block lost per
row added. 12 rows: need 11 520, worst block 40 960, 3.6x margin. 20 rows:
need 19 200, worst block 34 816, 1.81x. The sizing arithmetic that assumed
only the requirement moved was wrong by exactly the supply term.
`panel_co5300_draw_bitmap()` hands the whole length to `tx_color` in one go,
so height and DMA footprint cannot be decoupled without forking the driver.
**The rule:** the flush height is capped by internal RAM, not by appetite;
model BOTH terms before changing it, and only from a fresh serial
measurement. Make the tree cheaper to walk instead of the strip taller.
**Guards:** `DISPLAY_FLUSH_ROWS` back to 12 with both measurements in the
comment; `test_agent_demo_wiring.py` asserts the value and that the flush
fits twice in the worst measured block. **Watch for:** the CPU figure is what
made this diagnosable — 5 FPS alone cannot tell "waiting on a bus" from
"burning cycles", and 100 % CPU ruled out the QSPI clock that the whole
investigation started from. Also: this warning had been shipping unheard,
because the panel's only log is USB serial that survives nothing (OBS).

## 2026-09-17 · Burn-in drift scrolled the screen and LVGL drew the bar

**What happened:** grey scrollbars appeared along the panel's right and
bottom edges, intermittently — reported as "sometimes, especially
vertically". **Root cause:** `torget_drift_step()` translates the 480 x 480
`tg.shift` box by up to +3 px inside the 480 x 480 active screen. LVGL folds
`translate_x/y` into the object's *real* coordinates
(`lv_obj_pos.c`, `x += tr_x`), so the nudge is genuine scroll overflow, not a
paint-time offset. Every container here is built through a `bare()` helper
whose `lv_obj_remove_style_all()` zeroes the scrollbar part's opacity — which
is why nothing else ever showed one — but `lv_screen_active()` is created by
LVGL, never passes through `bare()`, and so kept the stock theme: scrollable,
`LV_SCROLLBAR_MODE_AUTO`, visible `#3E3E3E` bar. Only *positive* translate
overflows, and x is positive in 3 of the 4 drift steps — hence a bar on glass
3 minutes in every 4, the tall right-edge one just 1 in 4. **The rule:**
nothing may scroll the screen — apps switch by showing and hiding roots, so
the screen is marked non-scrollable at create time. Treat "this object was
never handed to our styling helper" as a live hazard, not an oversight.
**Guards:** `lv_obj_remove_flag(scr, LV_OBJ_FLAG_SCROLLABLE)` in
`torget_ui_create()`;
`test_burn_in_drift_moves_the_picture_without_adding_scrollbars` asserts each
drift frame's content bbox equals step 0's shifted by exactly that step, so
any future object painting outside the page fails too. **Watch for:** the
evidence was already in the QA fixtures — `torget-wifi-drift-1..3.bmp` had
carried the bars for as long as the captures existed, and no assertion looked
at the frame's edges. Captures only catch what something asserts about them.

## 2026-09-16 · The LVGL pool guard outlived the Kconfig symbol it named

**What happened:** the first USB flash after a routine component bump booted
to a dark panel. `main` spun in LVGL's out-of-memory assert building the WiFi
setup screen's 196x196 QR canvas, starving IDLE0; the task watchdog printed
every five seconds and — warn-only on purpose — never rebooted. USB was the
only way back in. **Root cause:** the bump carried LVGL 9.5.0 -> 9.6.0, which
deprecated `LV_MEM_SIZE_KILOBYTES` in favour of `LV_MEM_SIZE` (bytes).
`sdkconfig.defaults` set only the deprecated symbol, and the 2026-08-19 pool
guard *checked that same symbol* — so both reported a healthy 256 KiB while
LVGL used its own 64 KiB default. The guard never rotted; its referent moved.
**The rule:** a guard must read the value its consumer reads, in the unit that
consumer uses. A *minor* dependency bump can move the build-configuration
surface even when the C API is stable. **Guards:** `torget_require_lvgl_pool`
now takes bytes and reads `CONFIG_LV_MEM_SIZE`; defaults set both spellings to
256 KiB; `test_lvgl_own_default_is_rejected` fails the BUILD on LVGL's 64 KiB
default (aeea0c4). **Watch for:** CI builds the firmware but never boots it, so
this class arrives green — and the caret ranges in the five `idf_component.yml`
files admit it with no code change. The freeze was only readable because
`CONFIG_LV_USE_LOG` had just been turned on; without it the panel is mute.
## 2026-09-10 · A background scan still blocked every request through the lock

**What happened:** after a restart on a Mac with a large Claude/Codex
history, the light health endpoints answered but every `/api/tokens` request
timed out for 211 s, and the panel went STALE two minutes into a restart of
a perfectly healthy service (issue #62). **Root cause:** the first usage
scan had been moved *off* the startup thread in August (lesson 2026-08-26),
but `get_snapshot` still ran it inline, under `_cache_lock`, whenever no
result existed yet. Every HTTP worker took the same lock to read the result
and queued behind the one doing the scan. The warm-up thread did not help:
it was just the first caller to take that lock. **The rule now:** a request
handler never does the expensive thing under the lock that serves the
cheap thing. If there is no result yet, say so in the response and let one
background thread produce it; readers take the lock only to copy. And the
"no result yet" state is *named* (`usageTotals.state`), so a placeholder
never looks like a measurement to the doctor, the hook, the smoke test or
the relay publisher. And a placeholder is only handed to a client that
said it understands one (`X-VibePulse-Accepts: usage-totals`); the
already-flashed firmware would have applied the zeros as fresh data, which
a Codex review caught on the first draft, so everyone else gets the error
form the old firmware already rejects. **Guards:** `StartupSnapshotTests`
in `test_tokenserver.py` time the first request with the scan blocked,
prove one scan for many requests, the cadence-bounded retry after a crash,
that the block is captured under the lock with the counters it describes,
and the header gate; `test_publisher.py` proves a placeholder is not sent;
`test_tokens.c` proves the firmware flag; the doctor, hook and smoke suites
each classify the state. **Watch for:** a new producer that computes under
`_cache_lock`, and a new `/api/tokens` reader that forgets the header and
mistakes the 503 for a dead service.
## 2026-09-10 · A hand-written label map was a parser with six entries and a hundred inputs

**What happened:** the agent rows on the panel typeset six model ids by
hand (`MODEL_LABELS`) and let every other id in `prices.json` fall
through as a raw lowercase string clipped at 24 bytes: `claude-fable-5-1`
sat next to `OPUS 5`, and `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` rendered as
`claude-haiku-4-5-2025100` (OBS-30). **Root cause:** a lookup table is a
parser whose grammar is "the cases someone remembered"; every new model
was a silent miss with no test to fail. **The rule now:** derive the label
from the id's own structure (family, version, variant; every snapshot
date form dropped, including the compact `-0613` token before a variant)
and keep the map for genuine exceptions only. **Guards:** a test walks
every id in `prices.json` and every label fits the firmware column; the
compact-snapshot forms are pinned after a Codex review found them.
**Watch for:** an id shape neither grammar nor table knows — it lands
uppercased, not clipped, but check it against Claude's own client before
shipping a hand override.

## 2026-09-10 · A store that starts over on a bad file destroys the evidence on its next save

**What happened:** none of the three state files was ever corrupted in the
field; this is an audit finding (OBS-11) made into a rule before it costs
anyone 400 days of Max Tracker history. **Root cause:** each store handled
"cannot read" the only way an unspecified case gets handled: return an
empty state and carry on. The next `save()` then wrote the empty state over
the corrupt bytes, which are usually 99 % intact. Recovery was impossible
by design, and a non-UTF-8 `max-tracker.json` did not even reach that
path: `read_text` raised out of the constructor and the service did not
start. The parent-directory fsync (OBS-21) has the same shape: the quota
cache had it, its two siblings did not, because each writer was written on
its own day. **The rule now:** a state file that cannot be loaded is moved
aside (`<name>.corrupt-<UTC stamp>`) with one WARNING naming file and
reason, never contents, and only then does the store start empty; a
parseable file that lacks the shape `save()` always writes counts as
corrupt too, since a valid file cannot look like that. Durability and
quarantine live in one helper (`state_files.py`) so a fourth store
inherits both instead of re-deciding them. **Guards:** per-store tests for
invalid JSON, non-UTF-8 bytes and wrong shape (`{}` included, after a
Codex review caught that gap; a provider section that is a dict but not
the `{v, days, weeks, backfill}` shape `save()` writes, after the next
pass caught that one), and for the parent fsync after the rename. Two
more rules from the same review: a file that exists but cannot be *read*
(permissions, I/O) is not "empty" — the store starts empty but refuses to
save, because a rename needs only the directory's permission and would
have replaced the file on the first save; and when the replace has landed
but the directory fsync fails, memory keeps the new state (disk and
memory agree, only durability is unproven) instead of rolling back and
letting the next save drop a sample that is on disk.
**Watch for:** a new store that catches `OSError` broadly and returns
empty, and a loader that accepts a partial shape "to be lenient".
## 2026-09-10 · The parser read a field where the docs put it, not where the writer puts it

**What happened:** `/api/agent-status` served `effort: null` for every
Claude job since the field was added; the panel had a column for it and
never a value. **Root cause:** `_claude_event` read `effort` inside the
API `message` object, beside `model`. Claude Code writes it on the
transcript *record*, beside `type` and `version`. Nobody had opened a real
transcript and counted: measured on a live 2.1.267 session, 125 of 125
assistant records carried `effort` at the top level and none nested, while
`model` really does live inside `message`. **The rule now:** a new field
in an upstream file is located by *measurement on a real file* (count the
records, count where the key appears), never by analogy with a sibling
field or by the API shape. Write the count into the commit. **Guards:**
`test_claude_reads_effort_from_the_record_top_level` and its three
siblings in `test_agent_status.py` (nested still wins, bounded, never from
`tool_input`); the classifier reads the nested place first and falls back
to the record, so either layout keeps working. **Watch for:** the same
mistake on the next Claude Code field; `docs/companion-features-brainstorm.md`
lists two more measured shapes (`result` records, Codex `payload.info`)
that code must not assume.

## 2026-09-08 · New models outgrew the bundled price snapshot

**What happened:** Value showed UNPRICED after usage moved to Fable 5.1 and
GPT-6 Astra. **Root cause:** the loaded 2026-08-14 catalogue predates both
model IDs; refreshing the generated snapshot restores coverage. The service
caches prices and priced log records, so it must restart after a data update.
**Guards:** `GeneratedTableTest` checks both model IDs and independently
calculated cache-aware examples. Codex accounting/replay tests use a fixed
rate fixture, so later market-price changes do not rewrite their arithmetic.
**Watch for:** a catalogue refresh cannot price an unpublished model; leave
unknown IDs unpriced, and verify the live payload rather than only the file.

## 2026-09-06 · The panel logged the credential it was told never to print

**What happened:** all three failure paths in `torget_http.c` logged the
address they had just failed on — `hämtning misslyckades: … (%s)`,
`oväntad statuskod %d (%s)`, `kroppen större än … (%s)`. When the fetch had
failed over to the numbers relay, that address was the cloud mailbox URL,
whose path `/u/<secret>` *is* the access control: it reads the panel's
figures and overwrites them. `docs/relay.md` has said "Never print the
secret URL in logs or a shared transcript" since the relay shipped, so the
code contradicted a written safety rule — and a relay outage is exactly the
moment someone attaches a monitor and pastes the output into a thread.
**Root cause:** the logs predate the relay. They were written when every
address was a LAN address and a URL was just a URL; the relay added a
credential-bearing address to the same helper and nobody revisited what the
old lines print. Found by a Codex review on the #87 cleanup PR, on a file
that PR did not touch.
**The rule now:** a log may see scheme + host and which route was tried;
the path never. The redaction is **unconditional** — it does not ask
whether this particular address is the secret one — and it lives in the one
helper every failure path already goes through, so a fourth path inherits
it instead of having to remember it. The general shape: when a value
becomes a credential, the code that *prints* it is as much a caller as the
code that sends it.
**Guards:** `components/torget_net/net_log_target.c` is pure string logic,
host-tested by `test/test_net_log_target.c` (secret never survives, route
survives truncation, short buffers neither overflow nor leak).
`test/test_relay_boundary.py` parses every `ESP_LOG*` call in
`torget_http.c` and fails if one names a raw address — it catches all three
original lines. **Watch for:** ESP-IDF's own `HTTP_CLIENT` tag prints the
full request line at `ESP_LOGD`. The inherited default log level compiles
that out today; raising it reopens the leak (OBS-35, paired with OBS-28).

## 2026-09-06 · A photo of the panel carried the coordinates it was taken at

**What happened:** `docs/img/github/glass-live.png` was an iPhone 15 Pro
photograph committed straight off the camera — 3024 × 4032, 6.9 MB, a
quarter of the whole repository in one file. Its EXIF held a full GPS IFD:
a position fix precise to ten metres, with the altitude and the minute it
was taken. That is a home address, published, in a repository whose
`.gitignore` deliberately keeps `.ota-device` and `secrets.h` off the disk
because a LAN address is considered too revealing to share. **Root cause:**
the secrets discipline was built around *text* — passwords, keys, IP
addresses in files someone would read. A binary nobody opens was never in
scope, and a camera writes the location in by default. The size made it
into the repository the same way: nobody looks at a photo's dimensions
when the markdown renders it at 800 px. **The rule now:** a photograph
entering `docs/img/` is resized to what the page actually renders and
re-encoded through a fresh image with no `info` dict, so EXIF, XMP and the
ICC profile are all dropped rather than trimmed. Check
`Image.getexif().get_ifd(0x8825)` is empty before committing. **And do not
write the values into the write-up.** The first version of this entry quoted
the exact latitude, longitude, altitude and timestamp in plaintext — more
searchable than the EXIF it was describing, and it would have outlived any
scrub of the image. A review bot caught it. Describe what the metadata was,
never what it said.
**Guards:** none automated yet — `test_docs_frame_drift.py` deliberately
skips `NOT_FRAMES`, which is where every photograph lives, so the class is
unguarded by construction. Backlog item, not a claim of safety.
**Watch for:** the original blob is still on `main` and on GitHub. Stripping
the working copy does not unpublish it. The rewrite was built and verified
but could NOT be delivered: a repository ruleset refuses a force-push to
`main` ("GH013: Cannot force-push to this branch"). Scope is small — exactly
one blob (`e5e6190b4bb1`) carries GPS, and only 2 of the repository's 37
branches reach it, `main` and the cleanup branch. To finish it: lift the
force-push rule for `main`, then swap that blob for the stripped file with
`git filter-repo --blob-callback` and force-push both refs. Note the clone
this ran in was SHALLOW; `git fetch --unshallow` first, or the rewrite
truncates history to whatever the clone happened to hold —
`tools/snapshot.sh` now refuses in exactly that state, and taking a snapshot
first is the rule (AGENTS.md, Arbetsregler). **And `filter-repo` is the wrong
tool on a PR branch**: `--refs <branch>` rewrites every commit that branch can
reach, base commits included, so the branch silently detaches from `main` —
GitHub then shows the PR as 401 commits and 408 files with no merge base. It
cost two rebuilds here before the pattern was obvious. To scrub a string that
only exists in your own commits, rebuild on the base with `cherry-pick` and
fix the content on the way through; check `git merge-base HEAD origin/main`
afterwards, and compare the final tree against the intended one.
**Restoring from a snapshot:** `git clone <bundle> <dir>` covers branches and
tags — and nothing else. `refs/notes/*`, any custom namespace, and the
pseudo-refs `HEAD`, `ORIG_HEAD` and `worktrees/<name>/HEAD` (commits no
branch reaches at all) are left behind. `git bundle list-heads`, or the
`.refs` file beside the snapshot, says what is actually in there. To bring
back everything, after the clone — note the `-C <dir>`, because `git clone`
leaves you standing where you started and a bare `git fetch` here would update
the repository you are in, not the one you just made:

    git -C <dir> fetch <bundle> '+refs/*:refs/rescue/*' \
      '+worktrees/*:refs/rescue-worktrees/*'

    # then, for each bare pseudo-ref row `git bundle list-heads <bundle>`
    # actually prints — HEAD, ORIG_HEAD, MERGE_HEAD, ...:
    git -C <dir> fetch <bundle> '+<NAME>:refs/rescue-pseudo/<NAME>'

Three shapes of name, and a wildcard over `refs/*` reaches only the first:
named refs, `worktrees/<name>/...` from a linked worktree, and the bare
pseudo-refs. Those live outside `refs/`, so each needs its own line; omit one
and its commit comes back with no ref at all and goes away at the next
`git gc --prune=now`. A wildcard refspec that matches nothing is harmless.
A bare pseudo-ref refspec is not a wildcard, and that is why it goes on its
own line, conditional on `list-heads`: an exact refspec that matches nothing
aborts the whole fetch with `fatal: couldn't find remote ref HEAD`, and takes
the ones that would have worked down with it. A bundle whose repository had
no valid HEAD — only remote-tracking refs and tags, which is what a mirror
looks like — is exactly that case, and `tools/snapshot.sh` called such a
bundle corrupt until it started asking `list-heads` first.

**`--all` is not everything.** `git bundle create --all` means `refs/*` plus
`HEAD`. Every other pseudo-ref is outside both, and each can be the last thing
holding a commit: `ORIG_HEAD` after a `git reset --hard`, a rebase or a merge;
`MERGE_HEAD` during a conflicted merge, which can be all that still points at
a deleted topic branch — and which can hold **several** lines, since a paused
octopus merge lists every parent while `rev-parse` returns only the first; `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`, `REVERT_HEAD`, `REBASE_HEAD`,
`BISECT_HEAD` the same way mid-operation. Two commits, reset to the first, run
the tool: the verified bundle held one commit and the former tip could not be
read out of it. `tools/snapshot.sh` now passes the whole list alongside
`--all`, taking each one that resolves, and reading the extra lines out of a
multi-parent `MERGE_HEAD` as well — fixing them one name at a time just buys
one review round per name.

A bundle can only *name* refs, and those extra parents have no ref name. Their
objects still go into the pack (passing the OID as a rev is enough, verified),
so they survive; but nothing reaches them, so the tool records each one in the
`.refs` sidecar next to the bundle, and the verification probe creates a ref
per OID — which makes the commit count honest and, more importantly, makes a
missing object fail the snapshot instead of passing quietly. After restoring,
`git -C <dir> branch rescue-N <oid>` before the next `gc` is what turns them
back into something you can look at. An object in the file that nobody can
find is not a rescue. One is deliberately left out: `AUTO_MERGE`
points at a *tree*, the derived mid-conflict merge result nobody needs back.
`FETCH_HEAD` was on that list too, excluded on the reasoning that its contents
came from a remote you still have — which is simply false for a one-off
`git fetch /some/path HEAD` whose source is then deleted, leaving `FETCH_HEAD`
as the only name that commit has. It is included now, and the extra OIDs are
filtered to those no ref reaches, so an ordinary `git fetch origin` (one
FETCH_HEAD line per ref, all already under `refs/remotes/*`) adds nothing to
the rescue list. Noise there would hide the few entries that are actually in
danger.

They are collected **per worktree** as well, because
they are per-checkout: a rebase done in a linked worktree, which is
exactly where you do risky things to avoid touching the main checkout, writes
`worktrees/<id>/ORIG_HEAD` and the main worktree's `ORIG_HEAD` says nothing
about it. (`worktrees/<id>/HEAD` needs no such handling: `--all` reads every
worktree's HEAD already, just not the rest.) A linked worktree also has its
own **refs**, not only its own pseudo-refs: `refs/worktree/*`, `refs/bisect/*`
during a bisect and `refs/rewritten/*` during a `rebase --rebase-merges`, all
under `.git/worktrees/<id>/refs/` and none of them reached by `--all`. A
commit whose only reference was `refs/worktree/saved` in a linked worktree was
missing from the clone of a snapshot that called itself verified. The main
worktree's equivalents sit under `refs/` and were covered all along. The `+worktrees/*`
refspec above restores them without change.

Those ids come from listing `.git/worktrees/`, not from `git worktree list`.
A worktree whose directory was deleted without `git worktree remove` is
`prunable` and rightly drops out of that list — but its metadata, `ORIG_HEAD`
included, survives until someone runs `git worktree prune`, and it can be the
only reference a commit has left. Reading the directory is also what `--all`
itself does: it picks up `worktrees/<id>/HEAD` from a prunable registration
too. Live-ness matters for where you may write and whose dirty files to warn
about; it does not decide what is worth saving. **The reflog itself still is not in
there** and cannot be — a bundle has no way to carry one. Everything an
earlier reset or rebase orphaned lives in `git reflog` in the original clone
and nowhere else, which is worth knowing before deleting that clone.

All three destinations are outside `refs/heads/*` on purpose, and that is the
part that took three attempts to get right. Fetching into `refs/*` aborts with
`refusing to fetch into branch ... checked out` the moment the clone has any
branch checked out, which it always does. And a fixed destination under
`refs/heads/` overwrites itself: restore once, snapshot the result, and the
next restore force-updates the branch the previous one created. The two
namespaces above cannot collide with each other or with anything a previous
restore left, which was verified by snapshotting a restored repository and
restoring that. `git bundle list-heads`
(and the `.refs` file beside each snapshot) says which of them exist. No
recipe is printed by the tool itself: eight review rounds found a new edge in
those lines almost every time — lost tags and notes, a branch name containing
`$(...)`, an unnamed detached HEAD, a rescue ref that collided with itself on
the second restore — and a recovery command that is wrong in the moment you
need it does more harm than no command at all.

## 2026-09-05 · Pinning a screenshot's size did not pin its content

**What happened:** the global Wi-Fi indicator was redrawn in `d5be82d`
(2026-08-22), which deleted the Font Awesome glyph font
`platform/fonts/torget_wifi_22.c` and replaced it with the generated
`platform/wifi_status_assets.c` — a thick, bright-white fan became a thin,
muted-grey one at a different offset — and `be29dba` the same day made it
two-state. Sixteen of the twenty-nine simulator frames checked into
`docs/img/` still show the old glyph; the two Wi-Fi onboarding images date
from `1b6ba3a`, the day before. README, `docs/wifi.md` and the
release bodies have shown a panel this firmware cannot draw ever since.
**Root cause:** the only guard those files had
(`test/test_wifi_setup_wiring.py`) asserted they exist, are PNG, are
480 × 480 and are referenced from the README. All four stayed true through
the redraw. A picture's dimensions are not its content, and nothing looked
at a pixel. **The rule now:** a checked-in frame is either reproduced
byte-for-byte by a capture the simulator still produces, or it is quarantined
by name *and* by a digest of its file. The first version quarantined by name
alone, and Codex was right that this enforced nothing — adding a filename was
enough to wave a new stale frame through. No test can stop someone editing a
constant; the digest makes the edit cost a 64-character hash a reviewer sees,
and freezes what is already quarantined.
**Guards:** `test/test_docs_frame_drift.py`. `PINNED` compares four frames
byte-for-byte against a named capture; every other frame's Wi-Fi indicator
box must match a rendering the simulator still draws, and `STALE_CHROME`
names the twenty-five that cannot be confirmed. Two further traps found by
review and worth remembering: a **blank** indicator box proves nothing on an
unpinned frame (a takeover hides the header, and so does a capture predating
the indicator), and `--vibepulse-pulse-qa` / `--vibepulse-completion-qa`
never set the status to `NORMAL`, so every capture they write is blank — the
same tag has 56 indicator pixels under static QA and 0 under completion QA.
Feeding those modes into the allowed set imports blanks the panel never
draws. **Watch for:** twenty-five frames still unverified. Re-capturing one
changes what the README *shows* — a different fixture tells a different
story on the glass — so it is a documentation decision, not a test fix.

## 2026-09-05 · A QR code that outlived its access point

**What happened:** the WiFi setup window's QR stayed on screen after the
window closed. A setup window that expires while the panel still has no
network hops straight from `OPEN` to `SEARCHING`, and the `NO NETWORK` page
came up with a dead QR over the middle of it, covering part of the reason
line. **Root cause:** one control's visibility was owned by one branch.
`show(ui.qr, ...)` lived only in `render_open_view()`, reached only when
`state == TG_WIFI_UI_OPEN`; the non-open branch repositioned and cleared the
labels but never touched the canvas, and only `HIDDEN` cleared it. The same
split ran the other way: `render_open_view()` hides the network name behind
the code, so `NO NETWORK`/`JOINING`/`ON THE NET` inherited that and stopped
naming the network. **The rule now:** a state renderer with two branches
must set every shared control's visibility in *both*. Clearing text is not
hiding a widget, and `HIDDEN` is not the only exit from a state.
**Guards:** `show()` calls for the canvas, the action control and the three
open-view labels in the non-open branch of `torget_wifi_ui_set()`; pinned
capture `torget-wifi-open-to-searching.bmp` (taken *after* an OPEN state —
the older `wifi-searching` frame is taken before one, so its canvas has
never been populated) and
`test_setup_qr_does_not_survive_a_visible_state_change`, which reads the
canvas quiet zone from pixels and pins the whole frame byte-equal to
`wifi-searching`. **Watch for:** the fix is per-control, not structural —
a new widget added to `render_open_view()` can reintroduce this. The
byte-equality assertion is the backstop: any residue at all breaks it.
## 2026-09-05 · A timing bound that measured the CI runner, not the deadline

**What happened:** `test_mcp_recovers_after_absolute_drip_deadline` went red
on `Tokenserver tests (windows-latest)` at 0.719 s against a 0.6 s bound, then
passed on the next commit with no relevant change. **Root cause:** the test
took `time.monotonic()` around the whole `run_mcp(...)` call, and `run_mcp`
spawns a Python subprocess — so interpreter startup sat inside a bound that
was only ever meant to cover the transport deadline. On a loaded Windows
runner that startup ate most of the budget. The sibling test one screen up,
`test_held_response_timeout_returns_computer_fallback_quickly`, had already
been fixed this exact way; this one was simply missed. **The rule now:** a
timing assertion starts at a clock the code under test controls. Here that is
the server's own `httpd.request_times[0]`, so the bound covers the two
request/response cycles and nothing else. **Guards:** the test now measures
`finished - server.httpd.request_times[0]` and asserts `< 0.4` — it runs at
~0.13 s (the 0.12 s deadline plus overhead), fails at 0.49 s if the deadline
is merely quadrupled, and at 2.83 s if it is removed and the byte-at-a-time
drip runs to completion. The same PR's own CI then found the third one, one
layer down: `run_script`'s 4 s `subprocess.run` timeout timed out
`test_unicode_decision_is_emitted_as_utf8` on the Windows runner and passed on
a second run of the same commit. That one is a hang guard, not an assertion —
nothing overrides it and no test asserts it fires — so it is now a named
`SCRIPT_HANG_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30`, still proven to fire on a wedged script.
A sweep for the fourth corrected why the `setup._invoke` tests were called
safe: they do spawn, but Popen returns before the child boots, so startup
overlaps the mocked wait rather than serialising into it (elapsed = that
timeout + <=53 ms). The serial spawn is Windows-only —
`_terminate_process_tree()` runs `taskkill` — and
`test_production_process_timeout_kills_reaps_and_recovers` is the only one of
them on windows-latest: at `PIPE_JOIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 1` it permitted
0.1 + 1 + 1 = 2.1 s against a 2 s bound. It now mocks that to 0.25 as its
POSIX siblings did and bounds at 4 s. **Watch for:** every fixed budget with a
spawn inside — but only a *serial* one counts. `run_mcp`/`run_script` start an
interpreter per call; a killed child's `taskkill` is serial too, and invisible
on Linux. `loopback.post_json` and the tokenserver bounds spawn nothing.

## 2026-09-05 · The simulator could not reach the decision it was supposed to be the spec for

**What happened:** a review found KEY3's whole arbitration — 110 lines
deciding, in order, the Wi-Fi setup window's input ownership, the OTA
window's escape and hold-to-switch, the SETTINGS menu's exclusion,
foreground and escape, app-next, panic and the menu-open hold — living in
`tick_cb` in `main/main.c`. `sim/main.c`'s `poll_keys()` could not reach any
of it; static QA called `torget_settings_open()` directly instead.
**Root cause:** the chain grew one branch at a time, each of them small and
each of them obviously belonging next to the GPIO read. Nothing was ever
"moved into" the host layer, so no single change looked like the violation it
added up to. **The rule now:** if the simulator cannot drive it, it is not a
host detail — it is untested UI behaviour wearing a host's clothes. A
decision that reads only observable state belongs in `platform/` as a pure
function the moment a second host exists. **Guards:**
`platform/button_arbitration.c` (pure: no service call, no lock, no clock),
`test/test_key3_arbitration.c` pinning all eight invariants as a table —
including the notice close that fires from `maintenance_ui_task()` with no
button event to hang a test on, which could not be tested at all before;
`test_wifi_setup_wiring.py` and `test_settings_design.py` now assert neither
host names a button action. **Watch for:** the next branch. The chain is one
`if` in a host away from growing back.

## 2026-09-04 · The screen was honest, the API was not

**What happened:** once a Codex-only computer could start (entry below), a
review flagged that `/api/tokens` reported `dayTokens`/`daySessions`/
`monthTokens` as `0` on a machine with no Claude directory — measured zeros
where there was no measurement. **Root cause:** two honesty boundaries were
assumed to be one. The *display* was already correct: the percentages come
over as `null`, `pct_or_null` turns that into `has_pct = 0`, and the
presenter renders `–` with USAGE UNAVAILABLE; a value row of `0` is dropped
entirely. The *wire* was not, and neither was the log, where
`net.c` printed "0.00 Mtok idag" — indistinguishable from a real day with
no work. **The rule now:** check the invariant at every boundary a number
crosses, not just the glass. A field that no view renders today is still
read by logs, by future consumers, and by whoever is debugging at 2am.
**Guards:** `claudeSourcePresent` in the payload (additive; unknown keys
are skipped, so flashed panels are unaffected), defaulting to *present*
when absent so an older service is unchanged; parser tests for absent,
true, false and non-boolean in `test_tokens.c`; an end-to-end
`/api/tokens` test on a Codex-only tree in `test_provider_gate.py`.
**Watch for:** the counters still cannot be `null` — `tokens_parse.c`
rejects a missing or null `dayTokens` outright and every flashed panel
would stop parsing. The flag is the honest signal until that contract can
change.

## 2026-09-04 · A Codex-only computer could never start the service

**What happened:** the tokenserver waited — before binding its HTTP port —
in a 30-second loop until `~/.claude/projects` existed. On a machine with
Codex and no Claude Code the port never opened, nothing was advertised over
DNS-SD, and the panel found a computer it could not poll. **Root cause:**
the readiness check was written when Claude was the only provider and was
never revisited when Codex arrived. Codex usage is read from
`~/.codex/sessions` and needs the Claude directory not at all, so the wait
was gating on a directory the running configuration did not require. The
README prerequisite already said "Claude Code and/or Codex" — true on the
setup page, false in the code. **The rule:** a readiness gate names what
the service actually needs to serve, not what it needed when it was first
written; when a second provider is added, every "is the provider here?"
check is part of that change. And the gate stays a *wait*: a `SystemExit`
here is what once made launchd respawn every ten seconds and flood the log,
so the condition changed and the behaviour did not. **Guards:**
`_any_provider_dir` and `test_provider_gate.py` (Codex-only, Claude-only,
both, neither, and a file that is not a directory), plus a test that a
snapshot with no Claude directory is zero rather than an error —
`Path.glob` on a missing directory yields nothing, which is what makes
Codex-only a serviceable state and not a half-broken one. **Watch for:** the
same assumption in anything else keyed to one provider's directory.

## 2026-09-04 · A rejected request lost its answer on Windows

**What happened:** three `CodexRouteTests` wire tests failed on the Windows
CI runner with `None != 415` / `None != 403` while the same commit passed the
same job in a parallel run and on Linux and macOS. **Root cause:** the tests
prove that the server rejects on the headers alone, before parsing the body.
The test client wrote headers and body in one go, so when the server
answered and closed, the body was still unread in its socket; Windows treats
a close with unread data as an abort (`WinError 10053`) and discards the
response already sent, so `getresponse()` raised instead of returning the
status. **The rule:** a client that expects an early rejection must not
leave unread bytes behind it, and must not let timing decide — advertise
the body in `Content-Length`, never write it, and half-close the write side
so the server can still reply. A grace period that sends the body when no
answer arrived was tried first and rejected: it only makes the abort rarer,
because a loaded runner can miss any deadline. **Guards:**
`headers_first_request` in `test_interactions.py`, opted into with
`early_reject=True` by the tests that expect a rejection on the headers
alone (it cannot be the default: a route that parks a question expects its
body within the server's 50 ms first-byte deadline), and a legible failure
message carrying the socket error in `assert_wire_rejected`. The server
already drains the request before its 503 in `_reject_busy` for exactly this
reason. **Outcome:** that drain is now central. `Handler._drain_request_body`
runs from `_send` and `_send_no_decision` whenever the request advertised a
body that `_read_json_body` never took off the wire, bounded to
`REQUEST_DRAIN_LIMIT` (64 KiB) and `REQUEST_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_S` (50 ms) — a byte
cap *and* its own deadline, so a peer dripping one byte per read cannot hold a
worker. The bytes are discarded unparsed and unlogged, and the flag is set
where the body is actually read, so a parsed request never drains twice and
`test_partial_advertised_body_hits_short_deadline_and_never_parks` still fails
closed well inside its second. In `test_codex_interactions.py`,
`test_early_rejections_answer_even_when_the_body_is_written` deliberately
writes the body on the plain `http.client` path — the shape a real hook
client has — so the product-side drain, not the test-side helper, is what
keeps it green.
**The bound is also the limit of the fix:** only the first
`REQUEST_DRAIN_LIMIT` bytes are taken, so an early rejection of a body larger
than 64 KiB still leaves a residue unread and can still abort on Windows. The
reachable case is a real hook client posting an over-cap payload to a disabled
route (404) — a legitimate client sends a loopback `Host`, an allowed `Origin`
and `application/json`, so it cannot trip the 403 or the 415. This is accepted,
not overlooked: an unbounded drain hands any peer a denial-of-service lever.
`_read_json_body` refuses an over-cap body without consuming it, so that path
carries the same residue. **The 503 path is not the same bound:** `_reject_busy`
shares the 50 ms deadline but drains at most 8 KiB of *headers*, stopping at the
end of them — it never touches the advertised body, so only the idea is shared,
not the cap.
**Watch for:** the same abort anywhere else a response precedes an unread
body; if a hook on Windows reports a connection abort where a status was
expected, this is the mechanism — and if it reports one on a request that was
answered, check the body size against the drain cap before looking further.

## 2026-08-30 · Local activity was rendered as no active agent

**What happened:** the local `/api/agent-status` reported the current Codex
task as working, while the panel said `No active agent`. **Root cause:** the
panel's direct application polling had stalled or selected another advertised
host, and the separately opt-in live-status relay was disabled on both the
computer and the flashed firmware. The numbers relay deliberately cannot carry
agent activity. **The rule:** prove source detection and panel transport
separately; an empty remote route is not evidence that the agent is idle.
**Guards:** the setup table and plugin skill now map this exact signature to
both live-status switches without weakening the default-off privacy boundary.

## 2026-08-30 · Fresh values and stale copy could coexist

**What happened:** the local API, numbers relay, and the exact firmware LAN
target all returned fresh Claude/Fable/Codex flags; passive serial repeatedly
reported accepted quota payloads beyond two hours of uptime, while the glass
still showed `STALE`. A LAN timeout also recovered through the relay and
accepted current token totals, proving that transport recovery alone did not
make the rendered status authoritative. **Root cause boundary:** successful
parsing updated the cards and timestamp, but transport `STALE` was cleared only
by a later LVGL timer tick. **The rule:** the event that proves freshness must
synchronously clear transport stale, and logs must expose the accepted
source-stale bits. **Guards:** `tokens_apply` now unconditionally reconciles
app/UI freshness; wiring tests pin the order; serial logs print only bounded
booleans. **Watch for:** calling `hämtning ok` proof that the glass says LIVE.

## 2026-08-30 · One STALE label hid three different broken links

**What happened:** repeated incidents were troubleshot from scratch because
Claude-source failure, an old tokenserver checkout, and a live host with a
stalled panel HTTP path all rendered as `STALE`. The Codex `SessionStart` hook
existed but only injected static usage guidance; it measured no health. A
wall-powered watchdog restart also left no evidence without USB serial.
**The rule:** classify source, host provenance, and glass transport before
choosing a repair, and make recovery observable on its normal power source.
**Guards:** plugin 0.1.7 performs a bounded loopback startup classification,
pins the matching tokenserver source fingerprint, and tests every fault class;
firmware reports an exact content-free recovery-boot marker that tokenserver
accepts only after two LAN polls. **Watch for:** treating the marker as a
physical PASS, or expecting an already running Codex task to load a newly
released plugin without update plus a new task.

## 2026-08-30 · A disconnect-only watchdog could not clear wedged HTTP state

**What happened:** the first recovery candidate cleared `STALE` after boot,
then the wall-powered panel became stale again. Claude, the local API, and the
ESP32-compatible relay request remained fresh, the board answered ICMP, and
two later questions ended in computer fallback/timeout. **Confirmed failure
boundary:** the firmware's one Wi-Fi disconnect had no escalation when no real
quota success followed; the exact lower-level TLS/client trigger was not
captured without serial on wall power. **The rule:** recovery must be staged
and a real data success—not a reconnect attempt—must close the incident.
**Guards:** after an initial success, relay-configured firmware recycles Wi-Fi
at 60 seconds, wakes the quota task, waits for a new IP before retrying, and
restarts once after a further 45 seconds without success. Cold boot, LAN-only,
disconnected, and clock-regression states stay fail-closed; host tests pin the
transitions.
**Watch for:** calling the hard-recovery candidate fixed before it passes the
dedicated-power stale window and a repeated physical question.

## 2026-08-30 · First DNS-SD result was not the user's active computer

**What happened:** after the HTTP watchdog image kept quota data fresh beyond
the old failure point, the canonical panel question still timed out. Two
healthy `_vibepulse._tcp` services—Mac and Windows—were advertised on the same
LAN, while the flashed image's encrypted interaction relay was disabled.
**Root cause:** sticky DNS-SD discovery is suitable for choosing a data host,
but result order cannot express which computer owns a new interactive prompt.
**The rule:** diagnose numbers and questions as separate transports; a shared
panel must use the end-to-end encrypted interaction relay for questions.
**Guards:** agent setup and plugin 0.1.5 now name the multi-host signature and
require fresh flash consent. **Watch for:** interpreting a healthy poll against
the wrong tokenserver as proof that the current computer reached the glass.

## 2026-08-30 · A boot-time PASS hid a five-minute HTTP stall

**What happened:** after the discovery-capable firmware was flashed and moved
to dedicated power, the panel cleared `STALE` and completed one physical
local-LAN APPROVE round trip. Several minutes later `STALE` returned. The host and the
ESP32-shaped numbers-relay request were still fresh and the board still
answered ICMP, but direct application polls had stopped and a second
interaction timed out. **Confirmed failure boundary:** network-interface
liveness and one successful boot-time request had been mistaken for sustained
application-HTTP progress. The exact lower-level trigger was not captured
without serial on wall power; the always-powered panel also retained ESP-IDF's
default modem-sleep policy and had no bounded transport recovery. **The rule:** a physical network
PASS must outlive the stale window and repeat the interactive round trip.
**Guards:** the quota transport now records last success and, only after an
initial success, only while associated, and only when a redundant numbers
relay is configured, begins a bounded staged recovery before the glass becomes
stale. Target Wi-Fi disables modem sleep because this is a wall-powered live
display. The policy is host-tested and fail-closed for cold start, LAN-only
installs, disconnects, and clock regression. **Watch for:** calling ping,
fresh server JSON, or a single post-boot interaction proof that the panel will
stay fresh.

## 2026-08-30 · A fresh feed did not prove fresh glass

**What happened:** the Mac API and the numbers relay both served fresh Claude,
Fable, and Codex values while the physical panel still showed `STALE` and made
no confirmed LAN poll. **Root cause class:** provider freshness had been proved,
but the device-side hop had not; the installed firmware predated automatic
Mac/Windows discovery and the running board consumed the computer USB port's
full 500 mA budget, a known unreliable condition for Wi-Fi bursts. A Python
relay probe added noise by receiving a User-Agent-specific Cloudflare `403`
while the ESP32-compatible request was healthy. **The rule:** prove source,
local API, relay with the real client shape, direct panel polling, firmware
generation, and power separately. **Guards:** doctor now reports direct panel
evidence without treating relay-only operation as failure; plugin 0.1.3 carries
the decision tree. **Watch for:** calling fresh JSON a healthy screen or a
generic HTTP client equivalent to the panel.

## 2026-08-29 · A dead saved credential and a live quota source coexisted

**What happened:** Fable went stale after the saved Claude credential expired;
later the usage probe recovered through a newly started Claude client, but
doctor still described the saved credential as if the current source were
dead. **Root cause:** active process candidates have no readable expiry, while
the content-free guard correctly retained the expired saved-Keychain state;
the diagnostics then collapsed those two truths and prescribed a needless
server restart. **The rule:** diagnose active source outcome, saved recovery
readiness, and served stale flags separately. **Guards:** plugin 0.1.2 skill,
doctor/smoke regression tests, and the 15-second local reread. **Watch for:**
calling an expired fallback the current outage when `claudeProbe` is healthy.

## 2026-08-28 · Codex cancelled the panel before the panel deadline

**What happened:** the canonical physical question reached the VibePulse MCP
but returned computer fallback after roughly thirty seconds. **Root cause:**
the bridge and permission hook allowed 125 seconds for the panel's bounded
120-second hold, while `codex mcp add` left `tool_timeout_sec` unset and the
CLI's shorter default won. **The rule:** every nested timeout must exceed the
deadline it encloses, and setup must verify the persisted external value rather
than its own constant. **Guards:** setup now atomically pins the owned MCP row
to 130 seconds, doctor rejects the legacy missing value, and the Windows
release runbook checks the real CLI listing. **Watch for:** Codex changing the
MCP listing schema or maximum timeout.

## 2026-08-28 · USB-värden var inte panelens datavärd

**What happened:** panelen flyttades från Macens USB-port till Windows och
fortsatte visa Macens gamla kvot. **Root cause:** USB gav bara ström; firmware
pollade fortfarande en ensam kompilerad tokenserveradress. **The rule:** lokal
värdidentitet ska upptäckas som en tjänst, hållas sticky medan den är frisk och
falla tillbaka till den explicita URL:en när multicast saknas. **Guards:**
valfri innehållsfri DNS-SD-annons, strikt IPv4/port-policy, bounded mDNS-query,
NVS last-known-good och Mac/Windows-failoverprov. **Watch for:** att kalla en
strömförflyttning för ett källbyte eller att blanda endpoints från två värdar.

## 2026-08-28 · A healthy scheduled Codex source failed in the interactive shell

**What happened:** a direct Windows probe failed while the scheduled API
returned a fresh numeric Codex observation. **Root cause:** the task prepended
the verified standalone Codex bin directory, while the interactive shell did
not; login and `CODEX_HOME` alone did not make the environments equivalent.
**The rule:** diagnose a background source in the exact service environment
before calling it stale. **Guards:** the installer pins the verified Codex bin
and optional `CODEX_HOME`; the Windows runbook checks the scheduled API.
**Watch for:** using `Get-Command` or an unpinned shell probe as task evidence.

## 2026-08-28 · Real Windows startup outlived the optimistic Codex deadline

**What happened:** the background Codex week could remain stale even though
the standalone CLI and its task environment were valid. **Root cause:** a real
Windows `codex app-server` startup could take longer than the original bounded
probe allowance. **The rule:** keep the read bounded, but choose its deadline
from the slow real-host boundary and verify the production refresh path uses
that value. **Guards:** PR #37 raises the local allowance to 15 seconds and a
regression test exercises the production caller. **Watch for:** shortening a
provider deadline from fast unit-process timings or interactive warm starts.

## 2026-08-28 · A disconnected validation host is NOT TESTED, not green

**What happened:** the real-PC run stopped after useful host evidence but
before the final merged commit, lifecycle transitions, and physical question.
**Root cause:** remote-host reachability is independent of tokenserver health,
and an in-progress task cannot leave new evidence after its PC disconnects.
**The rule:** pin every PASS to its exact commit, persist only sanitized
checkpoints, and keep every unfinished row FAIL or NOT TESTED. **Guards:** the
current-main Windows checkpoint and support matrix link each claim to its
evidence boundary. **Watch for:** treating repeated retries, old PASS results,
or an active remote task as proof that the current candidate passed.

## 2026-08-27 · Codex CLI provenance changed shape without changing owner

**What happened:** Windows setup registered the exact release checkout with
Codex CLI 0.150.1, then rolled back because its own post-install verification
classified the plugin and marketplace as foreign. **Root cause:** the newer CLI
omits `marketplaceSource` from marketplace-list rows and reports the plugin's
local marketplace cache as its source, while the executable plugin path and
marketplace root still identify the requested checkout exactly. **The rule:**
version external JSON contracts by observed shape and keep ownership checks on
the fields that still name executable code and the registered root. **Guards:**
both strict legacy and 0.150 schemas have provenance tests; unexpected fields,
foreign roots, and foreign plugin paths remain fail-closed. **Watch for:** a
future Codex CLI schema adding another shape without a fixture from the real
Windows boundary.

## 2026-08-27 · Windows boundaries disagreed with portable-looking tests

**What happened:** setup doctor rejected Python 3.12, Unicode hook JSON used
the active Windows code page, and the task installer passed parser validation
but failed before registration. **Root cause:** the production reader preserved
`\r\n`, text-mode hook output inherited a code page, and the Task Scheduler
XML value `StopExisting` was passed to a PowerShell cmdlet that only accepts
`Parallel`, `Queue`, or `IgnoreNew`; its restart count was also 999
although the schema limit is 255. **The rule:** test machine protocols through
the production boundary on every claimed host OS, write explicit UTF-8, and
keep scheduler values inside the XML schema even if a cmdlet accepts more.
Execute non-mutating object construction in `-ValidateOnly`. **Guards:**
Windows setup integration CI, strict LF/CRLF and Unicode tests, three-script
parsing, runner tests, portable task settings, and a real forced-process
restart. Native failures are normalized to exit 1 because Task Scheduler did
not retry the long-lived action reliably even after PowerShell's forwarded
`-1`/`0xFFFFFFFF` was normalized. A five-minute repeating trigger is the
explicit watchdog; `IgnoreNew` prevents duplicates while healthy. **Watch
for:** schema values PowerShell omits or fails to constrain, and assuming
RestartOnFailure covers a successfully started long-lived action on every
Windows release. Task Scheduler also has a smaller PATH than an interactive
shell, so the installer verifies the optional Codex executable and passes only
its bin directory to the wrapper. Its service can also retain a pre-login
environment snapshot, so an existing custom `CODEX_HOME` is passed explicitly
to the child without changing it. Never infer background CLI readiness from the
installer's interactive environment alone.

## 2026-08-27 · A visible Windows Codex command was not a runnable CLI

**What happened:** Codex worked in the Windows desktop app and `Get-Command`
could resolve `codex`, but the VibePulse background read failed and a local
wrapper reported that the CLI was missing. **Root cause:** Windows exposed a
Store-managed `WindowsApps` alias that was not executable from the scheduled
background context; Task Scheduler also inherits a smaller `PATH` than an
interactive shell. **The rule:** Windows provider validation must execute the
standalone CLI from its stable per-user path and prove the app-server quota
read, not merely resolve a command name. **Guards:** executable discovery now
prefers `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\OpenAI\Codex\bin\codex.exe`, ignores
`WindowsApps`, doctor tests execution, and the public Windows runbook separates
desktop login, CLI execution, and fresh quota evidence. **Watch for:** wrappers
or scheduled tasks that reintroduce interactive-`PATH` assumptions.

## 2026-08-27 · A green build from an old tree hid the panel test

**What happened:** the panel first showed **UPDATE READY**, then questions with
only **LEAVE IT** or a buttonless private screen, while localized project text
contained boxes. **Root cause:** a valid but older worktree was flashed, the
attract label used an uppercase-only font, and the diagnostic questions did
not satisfy the one-recommendation/physical-fit contract. **The rule:**
preview, test, build, and flash from one identified checkout, then verify the
whole Codex → panel → touch → Codex round trip with one canonical short
question. **Guards:** the post-flash smoke recipe in `docs/agent-setup.md`, the
physical review dated 2026-08-27, plugin documentation assertions, and the
hardware registry. **Watch for:** treating a successful build, a visible
waiting screen, silence, or computer fallback as an end-to-end pass.

## 2026-08-26 · A ready sender did not mean a listening panel

**What happened:** Claude's hook parked and encrypted an approval correctly,
but the panel never answered; after 120 seconds the request fell back to the
computer. **Root cause:** every health signal stopped on the Mac side. A
running tokenserver, ready relay, configured hooks and an enumerated ESP32
proved four separate components, not the end-to-end receive loop; the matching
firmware relay block was missing too. **The rule:** readiness requires evidence
from the CONSUMER, and setup checks must compose dependent sub-checks instead
of making the user know which second doctor to run. **Guards:** the short-lived
two-poll panel proof in `GET /` (`_panel_health_snapshot`), Codex startup
health, and the general doctor's relay pairing report. **Watch for:**
relay-only panels stay honestly unprovable until the relay has a
privacy-reviewed panel heartbeat.

## 2026-08-26 · A background warmup still blocked the listening socket

**What happened:** launchd reported the tokenserver running while port 8737
stayed closed and one core scanned histories. **Root cause:** the first usage
scan was threaded, but the numbers publisher synchronously called the same
producer before the HTTP server bound, and waited on the scan's cache lock.
**The rule:** every startup dependency before `bind()` must have a bounded
cost; moving work to one thread does not help if another startup step joins it
through a lock. **Guard:** the publisher's first pass is asynchronous
(`publisher.py`), and a blocking-producer test requires `start()` to return
immediately. **Watch for:** new startup publishers or probes that call payload
producers synchronously.

## 2026-08-26 · Logged in did not mean the exported usage token was fresh

**What happened:** Claude kept working all evening while Fable alone became
stale; `claude auth status` still said logged in. **Root cause:** Claude
Desktop's long-lived child retained a frozen process token, while the separate
Keychain access token VibePulse can read expired at 21:52; the passive general
week fallback masked the split. **The rule:** login state and an out-of-process
usage credential are separate health dimensions, and expiry must be warned
before the first failed request. **Guards:** content-free `claudeCredential`
readiness on `GET /`, a 30-minute startup/doctor/smoke warning, 15-second local
recovery checks, and honest stale rendering. **Watch for:** hidden keepalive
prompts or undocumented refresh-token calls—neither is an acceptable fix.

## 2026-08-23 · Claude kept working after every readable token copy had died

**What happened:** the panel showed Claude `STALE` while Claude Desktop was
actively consuming the plan on both Mac and PC. **Root cause:** Desktop can
refresh and use credentials inside its running client without replacing the
launch-time environment token or the expired Claude Code keychain record that
the tokenserver is allowed to read. The previous recovery assumed real client
use always replaced one of those copies. **The rule:** authentication health
and quota-observation health are separate truths; use a bounded official local
usage artifact when it proves freshness, but never infer a named model pool or
reset it does not contain. **Guards:** strict v2/size/age/percentage parsing,
authenticated-reset reuse, OAuth-newer precedence, and regression coverage in
`ClaudePlanUsageFallbackTests`. **Watch for:** Claude changing the local file's
version, cadence, path, or `fh`/`sd` fields.

## 2026-08-19 · `sdkconfig.defaults` did not migrate the existing LVGL pool

**What happened:** v0.6 froze on any full redraw while the LVGL task held
the adapter lock. JTAG caught the exact failure rendering `61%` with
`plex_num_164`: LVGL rounded the 144×119 A4 glyph to a 144×128, 18,432-byte
temporary buffer, its allocator returned NULL, and LVGL's default malloc
assert entered `while(1)`. **Root cause:** the checked-in default had already
moved the PSRAM-backed LVGL pool to 256 KiB, but the existing generated
`sdkconfig` was still 96 KiB; defaults seed new configs and do not migrate old
ones. The always-created v0.6 WiFi overlay made that stale budget fail.
**The rule:** treat critical Kconfig values as build invariants, not defaults.
**Guards:** root CMake now rejects LVGL pools below 256 KiB and
`test_lvgl_memory_config.py` covers both sides. Verify the effective value in
`build/config/sdkconfig.h`. **Watch for:** changing `sdkconfig.defaults`
without regenerating or explicitly updating every existing build config.

## 2026-08-17 · The compiled-in IP address pointed at a network that no longer existed

**What happened:** away from home, VibePulse showed dashes while
Solelkollen on the same glass fetched happily. Hours of network
debugging followed — IoT VLANs, client isolation, router admin — before
the actual cause surfaced. **Root cause:** `TK_VIBEPULSE_BASE_URL` in
`secrets.h` was a raw DHCP address (`http://192.168.1.50:8737`) from a
network the Mac was no longer on. The runbook
(`docs/agent-setup.md` step 1) had said to use the Bonjour name all
along — "so the same binary works at home and on a phone hotspot" — but
nothing *enforced* it, and an IP typed in once during setup worked for
weeks before silently going stale. **The rule:** an address compiled
into the firmware must be a *name*, never a number; a number is a
snapshot of a DHCP lease. More generally: every compiled-in endpoint is
the next travel failure — WiFi credentials were made data
(`components/torget_wifi`), and the service address got a relay fallback
(`net_source_policy`) for the reachability class no rename can fix.
**Guards:** the runbook rule already existed; the relay fallback
(`test_relay_boundary.py`) covers the cross-network case; the verify step
in `docs/agent-setup.md` step 1 now greps for `http://[0-9]` and warns.
**Watch for:** companion-app endpoints (`SG_GLANCE_URL` and friends)
and any future `TK_*_URL` configured as an IP "just for now".

## 2026-08-17 · A global auth threshold refused every open network

**What happened:** on the road the panel would never join a café or
airport network. The serial log showed the SSID being tried and a
disconnect, with nothing pointing at why. **Root cause:**
`wifi_apply()` set `cfg.sta.threshold.authmode = WIFI_AUTH_WPA2_PSK`
for *every* network. The threshold means "refuse anything weaker", and
open (`WIFI_AUTH_OPEN`) is weaker — so an open network was rejected
before it was ever attempted. The line was written when there were
exactly two networks, both WPA2; it silently became a policy about all
future networks. **The rule:** a per-connection setting derived from
one network's properties must move with the network, not sit as a
global. Here the threshold now follows each candidate: WPA2 where there
is a password, open where there is not. **Guards:**
`wifi_apply_current()` in `main/main.c` derives it per slot;
`tg_wifi_pass_valid` treats an empty password as a valid open network
(`test/test_wifi_slots.c`). **Watch for:** any other `cfg.sta.*` field
set once at boot that describes *a* network rather than *the* radio.

## 2026-08-17 · The escape hatch needed the network it was escaping

**What happened:** designing WiFi provisioning, the first instinct was
to deliver it over the air like everything else. **Root cause:** OTA
needs the network the panel cannot reach — a fix for "no network" can
never arrive through the network, so the feature had to be recoverable
from the device alone. **The rule now:** the compiled-in `secrets.h`
networks stay an **immutable floor** that stored credentials can only be
added on top of, never replace. No entry written at a hotel can strand
the panel, so the worst case is "it does not join here", never "it needs
a USB flash to come home". **Guards:**
`tg_wifi_candidates()` always appends the fixed networks
(`test/test_wifi_slots.c` has an explicit empty-store case);
`test/test_wifi_setup_wiring.py` asserts the floor stays in the
candidate build. **Watch for:** any future store that *replaces* a
compiled-in fallback instead of layering over it.

## 2026-08-16 · LVGL's pool starved the flush's DMA and the glass froze

**What happened:** the Needs You build froze the panel intermittently on
hardware — silent, no panic: UI and polling dead, ICMP crawling, but the
idle task alive so no watchdog fired. A diagnostic build (heap heartbeat +
`vTaskList` on stuck lock + WDT-panic + poisoning) caught the `lvgl` task
**Running while holding the LVGL lock** with every other task blocked
behind it, at internal-heap `min=16 B`, `DMA-largest≈4.6 KB` — **below the
flush's 11 520 B** (`DISPLAY_FLUSH_ROWS×480×2`). **Root cause:** LVGL's
builtin allocator puts its `LV_MEM_SIZE` pool (96 KB) as a static array in
*internal* BSS; that plus the takeover's objects pushed the largest
contiguous DMA-capable block under the flush buffer → flush dies in
NO_MEM, render wedges holding the lock, whole glass freezes. Same class as
[One byte over budget froze the display] and the 2026-08-14 Vibbe freeze,
new starvation source. First fix guess (`SPIRAM_TRY_ALLOCATE_WIFI_LWIP`)
made it *worse* (min→16 B) — reverted. **The rule:** LVGL's pool belongs
in PSRAM, not internal BSS; internal RAM is for DMA/WiFi. Measure the
*largest DMA block* against the flush size, never total free — frag hides
in the total. **Guards:** `LV_MEM_POOL_ALLOC`→`heap_caps_malloc(SPIRAM)`
via `main/lv_psram_pool.h` wired to the lvgl component in root CMakeLists,
pool enlarged to 256 KB (internal free 22→147 KB, DMA block 7.7→53 KB);
new `LÅGT DMA-block` warning in `tick_cb`'s heap probe fires before the
freeze threshold. **Watch for:** any large LVGL/const array landing in
internal BSS; the flush buffer size changing without re-checking the DMA
headroom; CMake silently dropping function-style `-D` macros (the pool
macro must live in a header).

## 2026-08-15 · kickstart restarts the process, not the plist

**What happened:** the tokenserver kept dying with `unrecognized arguments:
--plan claude=100`, restart after restart, taking the whole panel down.
**Root cause:** the running launchd process was pre-GitHub code that predated a
CLI change; editing the plist and running `launchctl kickstart -k` restarted it
with launchd's *cached* ProgramArguments, never re-reading the edited file.
**The rule:** `kickstart -k` is for code changes (same args, updated
`tokenserver.py`); argument/plist edits need `bootout` + `bootstrap`.
**Guards:** none yet — the plist story lives in
[github-pulse.md](github-pulse.md); CLAUDE.md's OTA note still only mentions
kickstart. **Watch for:** any plist edit that "doesn't take" after a restart.

## 2026-08-15 · An optional feature was enabled in the wrong layer

**What happened:** the GitHub screen rendered in QA but never on the glass, then
came up with no data. **Root cause:** two separate opt-ins were missing —
`TK_GITHUB_SCREEN_ENABLED` (the view compiled out) and `TK_GITHUB_URL` (the poll
task compiled out). Both belong in the per-install `secrets.h` (see
`secrets.h.example`), but the screen flag was fixed by hardcoding it into
`components/app_tokens/CMakeLists.txt` (`b5c5a7a`) instead. **The rule:** enable
per-install feature flags where the design put them — local `secrets.h`, not the
shared firmware CMake; a build define collides with a template-based secrets.h
and silently wins the wrong way. **Guards:** `secrets.h.example` already carries
the full block; cleanup tracked in
[github-pulse.md](github-pulse.md#known-follow-ups). **Watch for:** any
`target_compile_definitions` that duplicates a `#ifndef`-guarded config default.

## 2026-08-13 · The expired token that outranked a fresh login

**What happened:** the screen sat on `usage_http_401` for hours after a
perfectly good re-login. **Root cause:** the probe read the OAuth token
from a running process's environment — which reflects launch time, not
now. A Claude Desktop child process outlived its token and kept
"winning" over the fresh keychain credential. A second bug compounded
it: the probe demanded an active session window, so between windows it
discarded valid weekly data and reported the *fallback's* 401 as the
whole story — blaming auth while auth was fine. **The rule:** report
the status of the source that actually decided, and never require more
data than the answer needs. **Guards:** keychain fallback + candidate
ordering (`7d213ec`), probe succeeds without a session window
(`8d3b4b3`), runbook row updated (`2002725`). **Watch for:** any new
credential source silently outranking a fresher one.

## 2026-08-13 · The 429 night: the probe fed its own penalty

**What happened:** a debugging evening ended rate-limited, repeatedly.
**Root cause:** on 429 the probe fell through to the header fallback
(one more request) and retried the full multi-request cycle two minutes
later — each retry extending the penalty it was caught in. A dead token
had the same shape: two doomed requests every 120 s for hours. **The
rule: failure must slow you down.** Every poller needs backoff, and a
rate-limit response is an instruction, not an error to retry. **Guards:**
10-min cooldown honoring `Retry-After`, cycle aborts on 429
(`c5510b5`); failure-streak slowdown 120→240→480 s (`8f6b8bd`); tests in
`test_tokenserver.py`. **Watch for:** the firmware pollers, which never
got this medicine — fixed cadences, agent-status at 1 Hz (OBS-13). Also:
don't restart the server to "fix" a 429 — that resets the cooldown and
repeats the mistake.

## 2026-08-13 · A stale worktree served old code for an hour

**What happened:** an hour of process archaeology because the launchd
service was quietly running from a different checkout than the one being
edited. **Root cause:** the plist hardcodes its `WorkingDirectory`; no
artifact said which code was live. **The rule:** every long-running
artifact must be able to answer "what revision are you?" in one command.
**Guards:** `GET /` reports `rev` + `startedAt` (`8f6b8bd`) and a
startup `srcFingerprint` (content hash — catches dirty worktrees and
post-start edits that share HEAD with the checkout); the smoke test
compares both against your checkout; the firmware boot banner logs its
version and reset reason (OBS-01, done). **Watch for:** the plist's
hardcoded `WorkingDirectory` is still the root cause waiting to recur —
the guards make it visible, not impossible.

**2026-08-28 recurrence:** the live tokenserver, Codex plugin, MCP registration,
and marketplace had independently retained absolute paths to older checkouts.
All could look installed while executing different revisions. Moving the
plist required `bootout` + `bootstrap`; `kickstart` would have reused launchd's
cached paths. The repair rule is now stricter: install all four integrations
from one clean, durable checkout, run setup doctor, verify live `rev` and
`srcFingerprint` with smoke against the actual port, and start a new Codex task.
Historical tracebacks remain in the bounded log, so a post-repair verdict must
also prove that no new error appeared after the new timestamp.

**2026-08-30 install recurrence:** the first atomic replacement restored the
old service after `launchctl bootstrap` transiently failed; an identical second
bootstrap then succeeded. The installer now retries that narrow post-`bootout`
race on a fixed short schedule and still restores the previous service after
the bound. During the same physical gate, ESP-IDF refreshed `dependencies.lock`
from `esp-nn` 1.3.0 to 1.3.1. The candidate was not flashed while the checkout
was dirty; the resolved version is committed so the source label, lockfile,
host advertisement, and physical image can identify one exact build.

## 2026-08-13 · Stale data replayed as breaking news

**What happened:** after a tokenserver outage, the revived agent feed's
hours-old "waiting for you" states each seized the whole screen as
full-screen alerts. Separately, stale waiting/error records displaced
newly observed work. **Root cause:** alerting and eviction logic trusted
*content* without checking *age*. **The rule:** freshness is part of the
data, and anything that interrupts the user must prove it first.
**Guards:** alerts gated on freshness incl. post-boot (`89f161f`),
cached quotas rendered stale (`ca55c30`), expired records evicted first
(`ef85bf3`). **Watch for:** the device's freshness clock is fed by one
endpoint only — other feeds can still show `LIVE` while dead (OBS-09).

## 2026-08-13 · Upstream data is hostile: the NUL-truncation escalation

**What happened:** four commits in one arc as each fix revealed the next
hole: quota labels arriving NUL-truncated could confuse parsing, then
detection, then forecast trust, then key matching. **Root cause:** the
JSONL and API payloads are *someone else's* output format, unversioned,
and they change and break mid-write; anything not explicitly validated
will eventually lie. **The rule:** parsers are contract-strict — reject
the whole payload on any violation, keep last-known-good, and when a
value can't be trusted, don't display a "probably". **Guards:**
`bbcd5ec` → `254f774` → `3d3825c` → `1d371dc`; empty Codex limit names
(`fa44802`); named vs general quota separation so Spark can never
replace WEEK (`0a0e98e`); hostile-input C tests in `test/test_tokens.c`.
**Watch for:** strictness without diagnostics — a rejection today logs
nothing about *what* offended (OBS-22).

## 2026-08-13 · One byte over budget froze the display

**What happened:** the screen went permanently stale against a healthy
server. **Root cause:** the worst-case v2 payload was 1 058 bytes; the
firmware's all-or-nothing body cap was 1 024. Nobody had ever computed
the worst case. **The rule:** an all-or-nothing contract needs a
capacity gate — a test that constructs the worst-case payload and proves
it fits, so growth fails in CI, not on the shelf. **Guards:** headroom
raised + capacity gate (`c0016d9`, `a90b6f2`,
`test/test_token_body_capacity.py`). **Watch for:** adding any payload
field without touching the capacity test.

## 2026-08-13 · Round before you serialize

**What happened:** the device rejected entire max-tracker responses.
**Root cause:** the server emitted float day-peaks; the device parses
them into `int8_t` and — correctly, per contract — rejected the whole
payload. Truth must be shaped *before* the wire, not after. **Guards:**
server rounds day peaks (`97dd531`); the recorded-live-shape fixture
`sim-fixtures/max-tracker-live-shape.json` locks the real contract into
the sim and tests. **The rule:** when a bug comes from real recorded
data, freeze that data as a fixture forever.

## 2026-08-13 · The log-tail state machine took four rounds

**What happened:** the max-tracker backfill (offsets, watermarks,
carried lines) was "fixed" four times; round 2's fix was rejected by two
new empirical repros. Failure modes included permanent starvation
(oversized line never consumed, offset frozen) and double-counting
(keying on `(inode, size)`). **The rule:** incremental-file-reader state
is the hardest state in this codebase — every claimed fix needs a
reproducing test *before* the fix, and reviewers should assume the next
hole exists. **Guards:** `6e8ebba`/`733bf9c`, `c5eae88`, `09badc2`,
`c7c95e5` → `4a5d761`, each with its repro test. **Watch for:** the
backfill loop still swallows runtime exceptions at 2 Hz (OBS-19).

## 2026-08-13 · Threads shared a list without a story

**What happened:** `ThreadingHTTPServer` request threads shared the
usage-history store with unguarded swap/sort/rollback. **The rule:**
every store touched by the HTTP threads needs an explicit lock story,
and slow work (disk, recompute) moves off the request path. **Guards:**
thread-safe history (`6966957`), nonblocking cache reads (`c0fddcf`),
async persistence (`4041f16`). **Watch for:** `_probe_status` is still
read torn-able without its lock (OBS-18c).

## 2026-08-13 · Inverted defaults shipped a stranger someone else's app

**What happened:** an outside user flashed "VibePulse" and got Swedish
electricity prices — and their board began polling the maintainer's
other project's website every 30 s (~2 880 req/day per device). **Root
cause:** companion apps were opt-out instead of opt-in; the governance
test passed both ways, so it guarded nothing. **The rule: the defaults
are the product.** A fresh clone must build exactly one app, and any
test guarding a default must *fail* on the harmful configuration —
tighten the test in the same commit as the fix. **Guards:** `57e00ba`
(defaults flipped + registry test tightened), `2ec791d` (the two-pass
CMake guard divergence that made "macro on, include dir off" possible).
**Watch for:** any new build-time gate needs both halves guarded — the
compile definition *and* the sources it implies.

## 2026-08-13 · A computer USB port cannot run this panel

**What happened:** flashing worked but the running board bounced off the
USB bus or hung; it looked exactly like a flaky cable or bad firmware.
**Root cause:** the AMOLED draw exceeds what a computer port reliably
supplies. **The rule:** flash in download mode (screen dark), run from a
dedicated PSU; interpret enumeration bouncing as a power symptom first.
**Guards:** documented in `docs/agent-setup.md` and README
(`9ddf387`); full narrative in
`docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-08-13-max-tracker-physical-static.md`.
**Watch for:** serial-monitoring a *running* board is still unverified —
it needs a powered hub or PSU/data split, which also caps how much the
firmware log can help until solved.

## 2026-08-13 · CI's fresh VM exposed a boot-blind throttle

**What happened:** the first CI run of the new logging failed a test
that passed everywhere locally: the throttled save-error log never
fired. Codex's PR review flagged the same line independently. **Root
cause:** the throttle used `0.0` as "long ago" with `time.monotonic()`
— which counts from *boot*. On any machine up less than the 5-minute
window (CI VMs always; a Mac right after restart), `now - 0.0` never
reaches the threshold, so the **first error after boot is exactly the
one that gets swallowed** — in production, not just in tests. **The
rule:** "never happened yet" is a state, not a timestamp zero; with
monotonic clocks use a `None` sentinel, because monotonic's epoch is
arbitrary and *recent* on fresh machines. **Guards:** `None` sentinels
in both error-log throttles; the writer test now exercises the
first-error path on CI's short-uptime VMs by construction. **Watch
for:** any new `last_*_logged` / `last_*_at` throttle seeded with `0.0`.

## 2026-08-13 · Docs drifted from code five times in two days

**What happened:** five separate correction commits: setup steps telling
users to uncomment a block that ships active (at the most expensive
possible step), a README advertising a page that didn't exist, an
under-claimed privacy surface, stale AGENTS.md claims confusing a
stranger's agent, and a verification step that "always passes and proves
nothing". **Root cause:** prose claims have no failure mode — nothing
red happens when they rot. **The rule:** prefer doc claims a command can
verify; when code changes behavior, grep the docs for the old claim in
the same commit; a verification that cannot fail is not a verification.
**Guards:** `439481a`, `3e2eb3c`, `289fea1`, `e353371`, `668f4c0`; the
two doc-content tests (`test_shared_amoled_skill.py`,
`tools/test_hardware_registry.py`) are the only mechanical ones — and
`design-qa.md` has already drifted again (OBS-26). **Watch for:** every
new doc in this observability set is prose too; comb step 7 includes
checking that these files still tell the truth.

## 2026-08-21 · A changing ring is not a changing screen

**What happened:** the Needs You countdown belongs to one arc, but its
`ring_permille` lived in the full-screen render key. At 10 Hz, every new
ring value hid every group, restyled the provider, reassigned all labels and
buttons, then moved the root foreground again. That amplified draw traffic on
the same partial-buffer ESP32 path that previously wedged in glyph rendering.
**The rule:** separate stable semantic state from small animated state; update
the smallest LVGL object that actually changed. **Guard:** the simulator now
advances twenty deterministic ticks and requires one full paint, multiple
ring-only updates, and unchanged ticks. The target's ten-second heap heartbeat
logs and resets content-free `full/ring/unchanged` counters. **Watch for:** any
timer field added to a `memcmp` render key can silently turn a cheap animation
into a full-tree repaint.

## 2026-08-21 · Internet access is not end-to-end reachability

**What happened:** quota and GitHub data were fresh through the numbers relay,
but Claude/Codex activity stayed frozen. The panel and Mac both had working
internet and were even on the same subnet, yet Wi-Fi client isolation dropped
their direct traffic. **Root cause:** “the Wi-Fi icon is connected” and “one
feed is fresh” were treated as evidence that every feed could reach its source;
agent status still had only the direct `.local` LAN path. **The rule:** model
freshness per data path, not per radio or app. A cloud fallback must keep its
own explicit privacy switch, expiry, source precedence, and honest stale clear.
**Guards:** live agent status is a separate default-off E2E-encrypted feature;
direct LAN wins for five seconds, authenticated relay rows expire, and an old
relay-owned activity view clears once instead of pretending to be live.
**Watch for:** adding another screen to a shared “connected” indicator without
testing the exact transport and stale boundary that feed actually uses.

## 2026-08-21 · Change detection is not a cloud write budget

**What happened:** the numbers Worker began returning error 1101 and every
cross-network feed stayed stale even though its code and KV binding were
healthy. **Root cause:** the publisher sent on every payload change; the
quota body includes a current-time field and minute countdowns, so it wrote
about every 30 seconds until Cloudflare KV's account-wide 1,000-write daily
free allowance was exhausted. The old arithmetic counted only five-minute
heartbeats and ignored real changes. **The rule:** a metered sink needs an
absolute rate ceiling, not only change detection. **Guards:** quotas are
capped at one write per five minutes and Max Tracker/GitHub at one per thirty
minutes; a regression simulates two continuously changing publishers for a
full day and requires at most 768 writes. **Watch for:** adding an endpoint or
shortening a ceiling without recomputing the account-wide two-publisher bound.

## 2026-08-22 · KV list requests have their own quota

**What happened:** after publisher writes were capped, the numbers Worker still
returned error 1101; Cloudflare identified quota code 10048. **Root cause:**
every panel GET called KV `list()`, so three endpoints at a 30-second cadence
spent 8,640 list operations per day. The KV list-request quota is independent
of KV read and write quotas; healthy `get()`/`put()` arithmetic said nothing
about it. **The rule:** budget every metered operation independently, including
discovery calls hidden inside reads. **Guards:** the active Worker contains no
KV operation and real-runtime tests make 100 repeated GETs without touching KV.
**Watch for:** replacing one explicit list with another discovery primitive and
counting only the document reads it leads to.

## 2026-08-22 · An eventually consistent index is not coordination

**What happened:** the first list-free design proposed one KV publisher-index
record so GET could fetch known keys directly. **Root cause:** KV is eventually
consistent, and registering a publisher is a read-modify-write operation. Two
concurrent first publishers can read the same old array, each write a different
replacement, and cause a lost update or displace a valid publisher. **The
rule:** a dynamic registry with capacity and atomic document storage needs one
strongly consistent owner, not an index convention. **Guards:** one
`NumbersMailbox` Durable Object serializes registration, counter, and document
storage in one SQLite transaction; real-runtime tests race eight publishers and
strictly reject the ninth. **Watch for:** any shared KV JSON record updated by
multiple writers, even when its maximum size is small.

## 2026-08-21 · One simulator pixel is not AMOLED-safe spacing

**What happened:** the shared Wi-Fi indicator passed pixel-count and placement
tests and looked plausible in the SDL simulator, but three bright rounded arcs
had only about one black pixel between their strokes. The physical AMOLED's
antialiasing and bloom merged them into one cloud-shaped blob. Its page header
divider also continued beneath the global slot, making the top-layer object
feel pasted over the screen. **The rule:** small bright status marks need
deliberate multi-pixel negative space at final native size, and shared chrome
needs a reserved lane in every underlying page—not merely a high z-order.
**Guards:** four muted 20×18 native assets render separated signal bands; the
raster test counts real connected components, while every app capture keeps
the eighteen-pixel lane to its left black. The one image is owned by the same
translated page shell as the header, so burn-in drift cannot make it appear
pasted above a page or takeover. **Watch for:** approving tiny rounded shapes
from enlarged simulator previews or testing only bounding boxes and total lit
pixels.

## 2026-09-13 · A test suite paid for a poll it never needed

**What happened:** the tokenserver suite took 92 s and the plugin suite 48 s on
a Linux runner, on three tokenserver CI jobs plus the host gate, for tests that
do almost no work. **Root cause:** two idle waits, not slow code. Every test
HTTP server ran `serve_forever()` with the stdlib default `poll_interval=0.5`,
and `shutdown()` only returns once the serve loop wakes and sees the flag, so
each fixture's tearDown idled up to half a second; about a hundred servers are
created per run. The abandoned-hook tests paid the product's `ALIVE_POLL_S`
(2 s) per abandoned wait because `await_result` checks liveness only after a
full poll, and the zombie test does that `MAX_PENDING` times: 16 s for one
test. **The rule:** measure per-test wall clock before assuming a suite is slow
because it is large; a hosted server in a fixture needs an explicit short poll
interval, and a test that exercises a product timing constant patches it for
its own duration and states its bounds against the constant, never against a
literal, so shortening it changes nothing the test asserts. **Guards:** the
four hosting fixtures poll every 20 ms with a comment saying why;
`AbandonedHookTests.setUp` and the wire-level reap test patch `ALIVE_POLL_S`
via `addCleanup`, so the product default is untouched and restored. Suite went
to 22 s and 11 s. **Watch for:** a new fixture copying
`threading.Thread(target=server.serve_forever)` without the interval, a wait
bound written as `assertLess(elapsed, 4)` instead of against the constant, and
"the suite is just big" as an explanation nobody measured.
