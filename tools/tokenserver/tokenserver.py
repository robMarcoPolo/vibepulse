"""The token meter's service: Claude Code usage as flat JSON over the LAN.

Scans the session logs in ~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl (the same source
the ccusage family of usage tools reads), sums tokens per day and serves
the glance pattern's contract on /api/tokens:

    {"v": 2, "dayTokens": ..., "dayTokensPerHour": ..., "daySessions": ...,
     "monthTokens": ...}

Design rules, inherited from Solelkollen's /api/glance:
  * Flat JSON, numbers not strings, and a rate (dayTokensPerHour, the last
    hour's burn rate) so the screen can tick locally between fetches.
  * No secrets in the response and no authentication: the figures describe
    token volume, never content. The service binds to the LAN -- do not
    expose it outside the home.
  * Errors answer {"error": "..."} -- the screen's parser rejects that form
    by contract and keeps its last good values.

"Tokens" are all that passed through the model: in + out + cache write +
cache read -- the only figure that honestly describes how much was ground.
Duplicate rows (same message.id + requestId, which appear when sessions
are resumed) count once, the same dedup the usage tools do.

Incremental: files with unchanged (mtime, size) are reused from the cache,
and files older than the turn of the month are skipped entirely. A full
first scan takes a few seconds; after that every answer is effectively
immediate. The aggregate is recomputed at most every 30 s regardless of
the fetch rate.

Run:       python3 tokenserver.py [--port 8737] [--dir ~/.claude/projects]
Autostart: see README.md next to this file (a launchd plist is included).
